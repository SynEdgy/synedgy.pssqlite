SHORT DESCRIPTION
    A Sqlite module for PowerShell, using Microsoft.Data.Sqlite

LONG DESCRIPTION
    This module provides a set of cmdlets for working with SQLite databases in PowerShell.
    It allows you to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on SQLite databases
    using a simple and intuitive syntax, leveraging the Microsoft.Data.Sqlite library.
    The CRUD operations are designed to be easy to use, with support for various data formats
    such as DataTable, DataReader, DataSet, OrderedDictionary, and PSCustomObject, and do not
    require the use of SQL queries directly, making it accessible for users who may not be familiar with SQL.
    When the basic feature set is not enough, you can use the
    `Invoke-PSSqliteQuery` cmdlet to execute raw SQL queries directly against the database.

EXAMPLES
    PS C:\> Install-Module synedgy.PSSqlite -AllowPreRelease -Force
    PS C:\> Import-Module synedgy.PSSqlite
    PS C:\> Get-PSSqliteRow -SqliteDBConfig (Get-SqliteDBConfig -Path <path_to_config>) -TableName 'Employees' -ClauseData @{ Name = 'John Doe' } -As 'PSCustomObject'

NOTE:
    Thank you to all those who contributed to this module, by writing code, sharing opinions, and provided feedback.

NOTE:
    This module is in active development, and new features and improvements are being added regularly.
    If you have any suggestions or issues, please feel free to open an issue on the GitHub repository.

NOTE:
    The module exposes type accelerators like [synedgy.PSSqlite.SQLiteDBConfig] and [synedgy.PSSqlite.SQLiteConnection]
    for easy access to the configuration and connection objects used in the cmdlets, mapping to internal PS classes.
    When using the `using` statement, you can access these types directly in your scripts ([SqliteDBConfig] and [SQLiteConnection]).

TROUBLESHOOTING NOTE:
    Look out on the Github repository for issues and new releases.
